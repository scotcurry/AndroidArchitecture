# Overview

This repository contains a Sample Application that exercises the [Workspace ONE SDK for Android](https://code.vmware.com/web/sdk/Native/airwatch-android).
The sample is written using the Kotlin programming language.  The applications has been written
based on the best practices laid out in the [Android guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide).


There is an attempt to provide documentation that describes each portion of the code that is relevant
to building an application using the SDK.
